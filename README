# Archive, Compress, Encrypt, Backup

 This script takes folders that it compresses to tar.gz, encrypts with openssl & des3 
 and uses rsync to transfer to a remote filesystem.

# Warning
This script copys the entire contents of the backup each time it is run so
heavy traffic can accrue.

# INSTALL
Open the main.cfg file and configure. Run normally.

You will need:
List of folders to backup
Temporary folder to store temporary files
Location to store backups

This script works with cron. Easyest way is to symlink (ln -s) it to the /etc/cron.daily folder

# RESTORE
Create file /usr/local/bin/decrypt with the folowing lines

---- cut here ----
#!/bin/bash
openssl des3 -d -a -in $1 -out ${1%.des3}
---- cut here ----

Usage:
decrypt example.tar.gz.des3

tar -xzf example.tar.gz
